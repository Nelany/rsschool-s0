# snake-game

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen's borders. The goal is to score as many points as possible by eating food, with the game becoming increasingly challenging as the snake grows.

The snake can be controlled with the keyboard. Points are awarded for each piece of food eaten. There is also an option to view the results of previous games.
